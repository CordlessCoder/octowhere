# Backlog

Open work that is not in progress. Each entry says where its detail lives. Optimisation entries wait
until the feature set is complete, because profiling an incomplete firmware prices the wrong total.

## Next

- Build the protocol in [`LORA-PROTOCOL.md`](LORA-PROTOCOL.md). Its "Firmware structure" section
  comes first: the radio moves into its own task, and I2C gets a single owning task.

- Take the framebuffer clear off the drawing core. On the compass it is now the largest cost,
  about 8.3 ms of a 16–17 ms frame, and it is paid per 64-byte PSRAM cache line: clearing only the
  visible circle saved 0.6 ms, not the 21% its area suggests. The candidates are a GDMA
  memory-to-memory clear, or core 1 clearing a buffer after flushing it. Either changes the
  buffer hand-off in `util::Swap`, and partial redraws rely on a buffer keeping its own pixels,
  so only regions due for a full redraw may be cleared. Measure with `bench/compass-states`.
- Build Shapiro and PP Fraktion Mono Regular from their full font files with fontdue's `chars:`
  option, as PP Fraktion Mono Bold already is, instead of the hand-made ASCII subsets under
  `assets/`. Subsetting Bold to the glyphs in use would also recover some of the 54 KB it
  added.

## Deferred, with detail elsewhere

- The partial-flush hardware check, in [`HARDWARE-VERIFICATION.md`](HARDWARE-VERIFICATION.md).
  Partial flushing is the default and the check has never been run.
- CAD, flash encryption, delta coordinates and temperature-compensated RTC calibration, in the
  "Deferred" section of [`LORA-PROTOCOL.md`](LORA-PROTOCOL.md).
- `panic = "immediate-abort"`, in the "Binary size" section of [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md).
- fontdue's opt-in 16-byte `Line` (`compact-lines`), designed in
  `~/git/fontdue/DESIGN-compact-lines.md`. Once it lands, it will ask octowhere to confirm that the
  linked `.data` size is the same with the feature on and off. The spike put 1,760 B of line arrays
  in RAM: esp-hal's default `place-switch-tables-in-ram` copies `.rodata.cst*` into `.data`. The
  planned fix is one line static per font. Measure with `xtensa-esp32s3-elf-size -A` against a
  build of the same revision without the feature. Enabling `ESP_HAL_CONFIG_PLACE_ANON_IN_RAM`
  would move fontdue's other per-glyph arrays to RAM in either layout. Weigh that before
  uncommenting it.
- fontdue's compressed line store, on fontdue master since `2ad75496` and not taken while flash is
  plentiful. It is one macro argument, `store: true` (optionally `grid: 16`), on
  `fontdue_font_from_file!`. For MarathonShapiro at 2.1 it stores the lines in about a third of
  their flash, draws 27%, 17% and 11% slower at 12, 32 and 64 px, and differs from raw lines by at
  most 1 unit. The earlier spike results are in
  `~/git/fontdue/MEASURE-LINE-STORE{,-V2,-V3}-ON-TARGET-HANDOFF.md`. The bench is the
  `fontdue-line-store` feature on `bench/fontdue`, which does not build against the current pin:
  its `line_store_bench.rs` needs the API port in fontdue's
  `dev-tools/board/octowhere-line-store-d3.patch`.
- opt-level 3 for the compass draw, measured on 2026-09-24 and not taken: the heading frame went
  from 22.6 ms to 21.6 ms with the whole build at 3, 22.0 ms with only octowhere at 3, and 21.5 ms
  with octowhere and fontdue at 3, for 150 to 175 KB more image. Branch `bench/compass-draw-rows`,
  built with `--config 'profile.release.opt-level=3'` and the package variants.
- opt-level 3, measured on 2026-09-23 at fontdue `381f935c` and not taken. The whole profile at 3
  grows the image by 108,496 bytes for under 1.5% on full redraw, flush and rasterize. fontdue
  alone at 3 costs 160 bytes for 0.3–1.6% on rasterize and no change in redraw. Revisit only if a
  profile of the complete firmware puts fontdue on top. Branch `bench/opt-level`.

## Xtensa-specific acceleration

Survey the firmware's hot paths for gains from instructions the compiler does not emit on its own.
Do this after the feature set is complete. Profile first and pick candidates from the profile, not
from this list.

What is established:

- The fused reciprocal works. `recip0.s` plus two `msub.s`/`madd.s` Newton steps costs 17 cycles
  above a multiply. `__divsf3`, the ROM routine every Rust `f32` division calls, costs 49. The fused
  result stayed within 1 ulp. The bench is on branch `bench/f32-division`.
- Rust does not fuse a multiply and an add, and `f32::mul_add` is std-only. So FMA needs inline
  assembly, which needs `#![feature(asm_experimental_arch)]`. `freg` is the float register class.
- At opt-level `s`, a short fixed-count loop is not unrolled. Write a sequence out by hand when
  its counter and branch would land inside the dependent chain being timed.
- By default the target enables `esp32s3ops`, the 128-bit SIMD extension, and `loop`, the
  zero-overhead loops. Also `mac16`, `minmax`, `clamps`, `nsa` and `fp`. Every loop in the bench
  disassembly still compiled to `addi.n`/`bnez`, not a hardware `loop`. Whether LLVM ever emits
  `loop` here is unverified.
- Moving fontdue's code into IRAM changed the warm font benchmark by under 0.25%, because about
  4.5 KB fits in the instruction cache. Placement is not a lever for warm hot loops. Cold draws
  are unmeasured. Branch `bench/fontdue`.
- In fontdue's 16-byte `Line` spike, the fused reciprocal replaced two `__divsf3` calls per line.
  It recovered 83–88% of the gap to the cached 24-byte layout, and the output was bit-identical
  on target. It saved 1,546–1,973 cycles per glyph against about 1,370 for the divisions alone,
  so the calls also cost through the float spills around them. The results are in
  `~/git/fontdue/MEASURE-COMPACT-RECIP-ON-TARGET-HANDOFF.md`.
- At opt-level `s`, a closure passed to fontdue's `BitmapIter::fold` was not inlined: the
  disassembly showed a `callx8` per cell, and a per-pixel blend through it ran slower than
  collecting a row and blending it. Hot per-pixel work belongs in a plain loop over a slice, or
  behind a per-row callback such as `BitmapIter::rows`. Branch `bench/compass-draw-rows`.
- `recip0.s`, `madd.s` and `msub.s` are verified on the core. The rest of the FP option, such as
  `rsqrt0.s`, `sqrt0.s` and `div0.s`, and every `esp32s3ops` instruction, are not.

Candidates to measure:

- Glyph coverage blending. `lerp_u8` in
  [`crates/octowhere-ui/src/chrome.rs`](../crates/octowhere-ui/src/chrome.rs) runs three scalar
  channel lerps per covered pixel. The SIMD extension could blend many at once.
- Framebuffer fills and copies in
  [`crates/octowhere-ui/src/framebuffer.rs`](../crates/octowhere-ui/src/framebuffer.rs), and flush
  staging in [`src/drivers/framebuffer.rs`](../src/drivers/framebuffer.rs). 128-bit loads and stores
  help only where PSRAM bandwidth is not the limit, so measure the bandwidth first.
- fontdue rasterisation. The rotated-label path is the fontdue session's call, using the numbers
  above. Its outline accumulation is the other candidate.
- Screen-rotation maths from the magnetometer: heading, `atan2`, vector normalisation. `rsqrt0.s`
  is the candidate there.
- ChaCha20 for the protocol, which is software today, and the SIMD extension could vectorise it. It
  runs once per packet, so it only matters if profiling says so. X25519 runs once per pairing and
  does not qualify.

The deliverable is a table of candidates, with cycles measured before and after and which ones
were taken. Each measurement gets its own `bench/<topic>` branch, per "Measurement code" in
[`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md).
